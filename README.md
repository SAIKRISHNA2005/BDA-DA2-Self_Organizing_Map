# Anomaly Detection Using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)

## Overview

This repository implements anomaly detection using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to identify fraudulent credit card applications. The SOM technique is an unsupervised learning approach that helps in clustering and visualizing high-dimensional data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for the analysis is located in the `dataset/` directory and is named `Credit_Card_Applications.csv`. This file contains various features related to credit card applications, which will be analyzed for anomaly detection.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn
  - MiniSom
  
You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn minisom
```
## How to Run the Code
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sethns/Self-Organizing-Maps.git
cd Self-Organizing-Maps
```
## Navigate to the directory containing the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Anomalies Detection using Self Organizing Maps (SOMs).ipynb"
```
## Open the notebook and execute the cells to run the anomaly detection analysis
